## 🌟 Overview

**InterviewFlow** is a comprehensive, production-ready interview management platform designed to revolutionize the way technical interviews are conducted. Built with modern web technologies, this full-stack application provides a seamless experience for both interviewers and candidates, combining real-time video communication with robust session management capabilities.

The platform addresses the growing need for remote technical interviews by offering a dedicated space where developers can practice coding interviews, conduct mock sessions, or participate in real hiring processes. Unlike generic video conferencing tools, InterviewFlow is specifically tailored for technical interviews, featuring integrated chat, session history tracking, and automated workflows that streamline the entire interview process.

### 💡 The Problem It Solves

In today's remote-first world, technical interviews have become increasingly challenging. Traditional video conferencing tools lack features specifically designed for coding interviews, such as session management, automated cleanup, and interview history tracking. InterviewFlow bridges this gap by providing a purpose-built platform that combines video communication with interview-specific features, making the process smoother for everyone involved.

### 🎯 Key Highlights

- **Real-time Communication**: High-quality video calls and instant messaging powered by Stream API ensure smooth communication without any lag or connectivity issues.
- **Smart Session Management**: Create, join, and manage interview sessions with ease. The platform automatically handles session lifecycle, from creation to cleanup.
- **Secure & Scalable**: Built with enterprise-grade authentication using Clerk and deployed on cloud infrastructure that scales automatically with demand.
- **Background Processing**: Automated workflows using Inngest handle time-consuming tasks like session cleanup and user notifications without blocking the main application.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Leveraging cutting-edge technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, and various third-party services to deliver a fast, responsive, and reliable experience.
